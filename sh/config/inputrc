## CONFIF CHOICES ############
# When listing completions, readline displays the common prefix of the set of possible completions using a different color
# The color definitions are taken from the value of the LS_COLORS environment variable
# If there is a color definition in $LS_COLORS for the custom suffix "readline-colored-completion-prefix", readline uses this color for the common prefix instead of its default
set colored-completion-prefix on
# Enable tab-completion regardless of filename case
set completion-ignore-case on
# Treats hyphens (-) and underscores (_) as equivalent when performing case-insensitive filename matching and completion
set completion-map-case off
# Common prefixes longer than 5 are replaced with an ellipsis when displaying possible completions
set completion-prefix-display-length 2
# Enable returning up to 500 tab-completions without having to be asked
set completion-query-items 500
# Don't expand the home dir tilde (~)
set expand-tilde on
# Scroll text horizontally on a single line when longer than the width of the screen, instead of wrapping onto a new line
# set horizontal-scroll-mode on
# Display the common prefix of the list of possible completions (which may be empty) before cycling through the list
set menu-complete-display-prefix on
# Attempt to place the cursor position at the same location on each history line retrieved with previous-history or next-history
set history-preserve-point on
# Tab-completed directory names have a slash appended
set mark-directories on
# Immediately add a trailing slash when tab-completing symlinks to directories
set mark-symlinked-directories on
# Do not tab-complete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files on
# Turn off the use of the internal pager when returning long tab-completion lists
set page-completions on
# Display completions with matches sorted horizontally in alphabetical order, rather than down the screen
set print-completions-horizontally on
# Only require single tab key press for tab-completion
# (Default is double tab key press)
set show-all-if-ambiguous on
set show-all-if-unmodified on
set skip-completed-text off
# Colored file types
set colored-stats on
# Suffix each returned file tab-completion with a character denoting its type
set visible-stats on
